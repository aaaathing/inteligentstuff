# neocortex
* predict what will happen in next timestep

# bg gating
* choosing possible goals
* choosing possible actions
* choosing to store information in pfc

# semantic memory
* stored throughout the neocortex

# episodic memory
* spreading activations / priming
* when recalled, episodic memories reactivate other parts of neocortex
* also activates semantic memories

# pfc
* different areas that maintain different information, like:
	* semantic information
	* reward prediction
* reasoning
	* evaluating semantic information, based on current goals and stuff
	* find relation between objects


# how it goes together
on Sep 6, 2025, i was at el carmelo and thinking about adding a layer that detect relations and a layer that recalls memories and pfc layers.

first, there is video input. the first visual layer processes it into lines and edges. the next visual layers processes it into higher level things.

then, there is a layer that recieves the processed visual input and other inputs, and it combines them into a representation of a semantic thing.

the bg can gate and store information from visual and semantic layers in the pfc.

the maintained representation in the pfc can also activate representations in visual and semantic layers.

the episodic memory can match information from visual and semantic layers (including activations from pfc) to some memories and activate the visual and semantic layers with the memories.

for reasoning, the pfc can find patterns in lower layers, and the bg can gate to store the pattern, and it can repeat for many times.


# multiple objects at once
low level areas process in parallel.
at higher level areas, the features and locations are mixed together.
but when paying attention to an object, the signals for the object get stronger and the other signals get weaker.
