# neocortex
* predict what will happen in next timestep

# bg gating
* choosing possible goals
* choosing possible actions
* choosing to store information in pfc

# semantic memory
* stored throughout the neocortex

# episodic memory
* spreading activations / priming
* when recalled, episodic memories reactivate other parts of neocortex
* also activates semantic memories

# pfc
* different areas that maintain different information, like:
	* semantic information
	* reward prediction
* reasoning
	* evaluating semantic information, based on current goals and stuff
	* find relation between objects

# multiple objects at once
low level areas process in parallel.
at higher level areas, the features and locations are mixed together.
but when paying attention to an object, the signals for the object get stronger and the other signals get weaker.
