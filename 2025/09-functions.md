# neocortex
* predict what will happen in next timestep

# temporal lobe
* stores semantic memory and episodic memory

# bg gating
* choosing possible goals
* choosing possible actions
* choosing to store information in pfc

# semantic memory
* stored throughout the neocortex

# episodic memory
* spreading activations / priming
* when recalled, episodic memories reactivate other parts of neocortex

# pfc
* maintain information, like:
	* semantic information
	* reward prediction
* evaluating semantic information, based on current goals and stuff
	* find relation between objects
